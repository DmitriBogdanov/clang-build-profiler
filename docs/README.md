# clang-build-profiler

**clang-build-profiler** is a CLI tool that analyzes timings generated by `clang++ -ftime-trace` and generates a human-readable report, summarizing which parts of the build took the longest.

## Quick showcase

1. Build your project using `clang++` with `-ftime-trace` flag enabled

2. Point the CLI tool at the [CMake]() build directory and select its desired output:

```sh
clang-build-profiler --build=build/ --output=mkdocs
```

3. Open the generated report:

```sh
(cd .cbp && mkdocs serve --open)
```

4. Available output formats include:

| `--output` | Description                                                  | Requirements                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `mkdocs`   | Nicest output for viewing, it uses [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to serve an interactive GUI in browser | `pip install mkdocs-material` |
| `html`     | Stand-alone HTML report, not as fancy, but doesn't require MkDocs | None                          |
| `terminal` | Colored in-terminal output, useful for small projects or with high level of pruning | None                          |
| `json`     | JSON dump of profiling data, useful for custom analysis pipelines | None                          |
| `text`     | Text file output, useful for saving human-readable build artifacts with profiling data | None                          |

## Features

- Builds a tree of includes and their parse timings
- Builds a tree of template instantiations and their timings
- Summarizes the information above into a digestible format
- Prettifies standard templates and their expansion (e.g. `std::basic_string<char, ...>` ➜ `std::string`)
- Automatically analyzes CMake builds with multiple targets

## Documentation

The [project website]() serves as its main form of documentation.

The docs can also be viewed directly from GitHub:

- [Getting started](getting_started.md)
- [Configuration file](configuration_file.md)
- [Supported CLI flags](cli_arguments.md)
- [Building the project locally](building_locally.md)
- [Technical limitations](technical_limitations.md)

A shorter built-in documentation can be accessed with `clang-build-profiler --help`.

## Motivation

In many cases, build times can be noticeably improved through a relatively minor reorganization. To make this feasible, however, one would need a proper tool capable of profiling the build process.

`clang++ -ftime-trace` introduced in version `9.0` provides a perfect backend for such a tool, it generates traces in the [Chrome tracing format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CvAClvFfyA5R-PhYUmn5OOQtYMH4h6I0nSsKchNAySU), which can be even opened directly using Chrome `about:tracing`. However, raw traces are quite cumbersome to analyze in respect to the things that we actually care about, so I implemented a tool to summarize the key information.

## Roadmap

- Possibly a native GUI output with `--output=gui`
- Refinements in template prettification
- Tests on larger codebases
- A better selection of summaries
- Performance improvements
